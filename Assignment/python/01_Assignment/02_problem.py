# Exercise 2: Code Completion (Operator Precedence & Floor Math)
# Fill in the blanks ___ to make the assertions pass.
# 1. Complete the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 2
n_compounds = 12

# Hint: Use parentheses carefully for precedence and the correct exponent operator
amount = principal * (1 + rate / n_compounds) ** (n_compounds * time)

# 2. Get the number of remaining hours after removing full days from a total
total_hours = 130
remaining_hours = total_hours % 24 # Complete with the correct operator

# 3. Calculate full 7-day weeks in a total number of days
total_days = 45
full_weeks = total_days // 7 # Complete with integer division operator

print(f"Amount: {round(amount, 2)}")
print(f"Remaining Hours: {remaining_hours}")
print(f"Full Weeks: {full_weeks}")
